🚀 Todo App – A Clean, Fast & Polished Task Manager

A minimal, fast, and surprisingly polished Todo App built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no shortcuts.

This project proves one thing:

👉 You don’t need React to write clean UI + state logic. You just need discipline.

The app features smooth UX, localStorage persistence, live progress tracking, and a confetti celebration when the user completes all tasks.

🌟 Features That Actually Matter

✔️ Add tasks
✔️ Mark tasks as completed
✔️ Edit tasks
✔️ Delete tasks
✔️ Persistent storage using localStorage
✔️ Dynamic progress bar
✔️ Auto-saved state
✔️ Confetti explosion when all tasks are completed
✔️ Mobile-friendly responsive UI
✔️ Clear, readable code with real DOM manipulation
✔️ Lightweight: 0 libraries (except confetti)
